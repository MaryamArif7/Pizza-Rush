Deep Dive into Concepts:
1. React Functions in Props: Closure Concept
What is a Closure?
A closure in JavaScript is when a function "remembers" the variables from its lexical scope, even after that scope has exited.

In simpler terms, when you pass a function as a prop from a parent to a child component, that function retains access to the parentâ€™s variables and state, even when it is executed in the child component.

In This Context:
Functions like handleAddtoCart and handleGetMenuDetails are closures.

When these functions are defined in the Menu component, they have access to:

The user object from Redux (state.auth.user).
The dispatch function from useDispatch().
Any other variables or functions within the Menu component's scope.
Example:

jsx
Copy code
function handleAddtoCart(getMenuId) {
  dispatch(
    addToCart({
      id: user?.id, // Redux user's ID
      menuId: getMenuId, // Passed from child
      quantity: 1,
    })
  );
}
Even though handleAddtoCart is called in MenuCard, it retains access to dispatch and user from Menu because of closures.
How It Works:

When Menu renders, handleAddtoCart is created as a function within Menu's scope.
This function is passed to MenuCard as a prop.
When MenuCard executes handleAddtoCart(menu._id), the function still "knows" about dispatch and user because it's a closure
